### Why Rumi??

When I initially joined Twitter, I was unsure of whom to follow. I finally decided to follow accounts that tweet about books and motivational quotes. That was the day when I stumbled upon the work of Rumi. One of his quotes, in particular, captivated me and has held a special place in my heart ever since - 
> "Set your life on fire. Seek those who fan your flames."

Since then, I have delved deeper into Rumi's life and work, including his journey through Elif Shafak's masterpiece, "Forty Rules Of Love." Rumi's work has touched the lives of countless individuals over the centuries, and it is not difficult to see why. His poetry and philosophy inspire us to seek the beauty in our lives, to embrace love, and to let go of our fears and doubts.<br/>
